# Handover Review — corrections, drift punch list, and chat-only findings

Companion to [`HANDOVER.md`](../HANDOVER.md). That document is the project state;
this one records **what in it was wrong**, **which docs still disagree with the
code**, and **what existed only in a chat transcript** and would otherwise be
lost.

Written 2026-09-13, at `641da5a`+. The intent is that a fresh session executes
from the repo rather than from pasted conversation.

---

## 1. Corrections to HANDOVER.md

### 1.1 CI exists — and that is the *point* of B1 ❗

> **Resolved.** Kept below as the record of the reasoning, which was
> correct. The two-manifest split is gone: `requirements.txt` is deleted
> and CI installs from `pyproject.toml`. The analysis *understated* the
> problem — see §7.2.

**HANDOVER.md claimed (§1 Infrastructure and §5 item 10): "no CI pipeline",
"No pipeline exists."** That was wrong. Verified:

```
.github/workflows/ci.yml    pytest on Python 3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13
                            triggers: push + pull_request to main
                            install step: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Both claims are now fixed in `HANDOVER.md`.

The correction matters more than the fact, because it explains **how green CI
and a broken install coexist**:

| source | contains `pyjwt`? | used by |
|---|---|---|
| `requirements.txt` | **yes** | CI install step, Docker |
| `pyproject.toml` `[project].dependencies` | **no** | `pip install -e .`, any wheel build |

`autornd/api/auth.py:10` does `import jwt`. CI installs from the file that has
it, so the suite passes on three Python versions while an editable or packaged
install has no JWT library at all. **CI was never going to catch B1** — not
because CI is missing, but because it exercises only one of two dependency
manifests.

### 1.2 The doc set was under-reported

`HANDOVER.md` §2.2 lists only `.py`/`.yaml`/`.html`. The repo root also carries
`CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, `README.md` and now
`HANDOVER.md` + this file. Three of those have drifted — §2.

### 1.3 Numbering note

`HANDOVER.md` §4.2 numbers known issues **B1–B10**. Any item referred to as
**B11 or higher originates outside that document** (i.e. from the advisor
session). The CLAUDE.md rewrite was handed to this session as "B11"; it is done
(§3.1) and is recorded here rather than renumbered into HANDOVER, so the two
numbering schemes do not silently merge.

---

## 2. Doc-drift punch list

Ordered by how much damage the drift does.

| # | file | status | drift |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | `CONTRIBUTING.md` | **misdirects** | Tells contributors to "wire new phases into `autornd/engine/workflow.py`" — the **legacy** sequencer kept only as the graph's equivalence reference. Correct path: add a `_phase_<name>` method to `graph/adapter.py` and a node to a `workflows/*.yaml`. Also says to "add new `SpecialistRole` entries to `autornd/models/verdicts.py`" — roles are an **open vocabulary** now; you declare them under `roles:` in a profile and an undeclared one resolves to a generalist. A contributor following this file today builds on the deprecated path. |
| D2 | `CHANGELOG.md` | **frozen** | Last entry `[0.1.0] — 2026-09-12`: "5-phase sequencer", "Full test suite (85 tests)", and a model nickname ("K3 escalation autopsy pattern"). Sixteen commits of substantial change are unrecorded — the workflow graph, the eval harness, outward research, open domain/role vocabularies, client-side accounting, provider pinning, the review gate, and the `unrecallable` axis. |
| D3 | `README.md` | **stale + one model name** | Says **"339 tests"** in two places (`:728`, `:771`); actual count is **501**. Line `:103` names a specific model ("Sonar-pro bills $15.00 per million…"), which breaks the zero-model-names rule. The measurement should stay; the vendor name should become "a sonar-class search model" or similar. |
| D4 | `CLAUDE.md` | ✅ **done** | Rewritten — §3.1. |
| D5 | `HANDOVER.md` | ✅ **done** | §1.1 and §1.2 corrections applied. |

---

## 3. Work completed in this pass

### 3.1 CLAUDE.md rewritten

Short, current, **zero model names** (verified by grep: 0 hits across
deepseek/minimax/glm/kimi/gemini/sonar/qwen/gpt/mistral/llama/claude/openai/
anthropic). Replaces a version that:

- named five specific models in a "Model Routing" table,
- claimed "133 tests (9 test files)" against the real 501 / 17,
- omitted `graph/` and `evals/` entirely,
- described the pipeline as a hardcoded sequence rather than a YAML graph,
- said nothing about the research and search tiers, open vocabularies,
  client-side accounting, the review gate, `unrecallable`, or provider pinning,
- referred to a model by nickname ("K3 escalation uses static/dynamic payload
  split").

The rewrite is organised as: what it is → stack → layout → pipeline → tiers →
**twelve invariants** → commands → style. The invariants are the load-bearing
part; they encode the rules that were each learned by breaking something.

### 3.2 Reworked CI step — extend, do not create

> **Shipped**, with three departures from the draft below, each forced by
> something the live install revealed — §7.2.

The brief's step 3 changes from "add CI" to **"add an editable-install job"**,
because CI exists and is green. Below is the substance, ready to drop in when B1
is opened. It fails today (which is the point) and passes once `pyjwt` is added
to `pyproject.toml`:

```yaml
  # append to .github/workflows/ci.yml
  editable-install:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"

      # Installs from pyproject.toml, NOT requirements.txt. The existing `test`
      # job installs from requirements.txt, which is why a missing pyproject
      # dependency (pyjwt / B1) passed CI on three Python versions while
      # `pip install -e .` produced an unusable install.
      - name: Editable install from project metadata
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -e .

      # Import the modules a real process touches at startup. The gap was a
      # transitive import (api/auth.py -> jwt), so importing the package alone
      # would not have caught it.
      - name: Import smoke test
        run: |
          python -c "
          import autornd.main, autornd.api.auth, autornd.api.routes
          import autornd.graph.executor, autornd.routing.openrouter
          import autornd.evals.runner
          print('editable install imports clean')
          "
```

Two deliberate choices: a **single** Python version (this job tests packaging
metadata, not version compatibility — the matrix already covers that), and an
**import** smoke test rather than `pytest`, because the tests run against the
source tree and would pass regardless of install metadata.

---

## 4. Chat-only findings — the skim

The brief predicted a small yield, expecting only B6 failure traces (not needed),
failed prompt wordings (recoverable from git diffs) and provider tables (already
in `HANDOVER.md` §6.1). **That prediction was wrong in one direction:** the
model-selection research is substantial, was never committed, and is the highest
cost-leverage material produced. It is recorded here in full.

### 4.1 ❗ The search tier is on the most expensive option in its family

From the live OpenRouter catalogue (445 models, fetched 2026-09-13):

| model | in $/M | out $/M | ctx |
|---|---|---|---|
| `perplexity/sonar` | 1.00 | **1.00** | 127k |
| `perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro` | 2.00 | 8.00 | 128k |
| `perplexity/sonar-deep-research` | 2.00 | 8.00 | 128k |
| `perplexity/sonar-pro` ← **current** | 3.00 | **15.00** | 200k (max out 8000) |

Search is **61–98% of all spend** (`HANDOVER.md` §6.3). The non-pro model is
**15× cheaper in the same family**. This is the single largest untested cost
lever in the project, and the grounding eval grades it directly.

**Second-order effect if `sonar` wins:** the per-request fee is ~$0.00698 and
fixed. At $15/M output it is 13% of a 3000-token lookup; at $1/M it becomes
**~64%**. The token economics invert — a *generous* token budget becomes nearly
free, and the owner's original instinct ("it's per call, so give it max tokens")
becomes correct for the first time.

### 4.2 Real prices of the currently-configured tiers

Three of six are mispriced for their job:

| tier | configured model | out $/M | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| search | `perplexity/sonar-pro` | **15.00** | §4.1 — 15× alternative exists |
| escalation | `moonshotai/kimi-k3` | **13.28** | rare enough to defend |
| architecture | `z-ai/glm-5.3` | **4.40** | expensive **and** reasoning **and** stubs on planning |
| research | `google/gemini-2.5-flash` | **2.50** | a summarisation tier at 2× the engineering tier; max out only 65,535 |
| engineering | `minimax/minimax-m3` | 1.20 | fair price, silent-failure mode |
| triage | `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` | 0.18 | good value; provider-sensitive (§6.1) |

`glm-5.3` is **not** a mid-tier model at $4.40/M — a working assumption that had
gone unchecked.

### 4.3 The selection criterion that matters here

Catalogue field `supported_parameters` is the discriminator, and the filter is:

> **`structured_outputs` present AND `reasoning` absent**

Every phase fills a typed schema. A reasoning-capable model can spend its whole
output budget thinking and emit nothing — the measured failure mode of both the
engineering and architecture tiers (`HANDOVER.md` §6.4). **54 models** pass that
filter under $3/M with ≥100k context.

Best value per tier, selected on catalogue signals (price, non-reasoning,
context, max-output, model class) — **not** on reputation, since several of
these postdate the assistant's knowledge cutoff:

| tier | candidate | out $/M | rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| search | `perplexity/sonar` | 1.00 | §4.1 |
| architecture | `mistralai/mistral-large-2512` | 1.50 | large-class, non-reasoning, 209k max out |
| | `openai/gpt-4.1-mini` | 1.60 | 1M ctx, reliable at JSON |
| | `moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905` | 2.50 | non-reasoning sibling of the escalation model |
| engineering | `qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507` | 0.35 | 235B MoE, non-reasoning, 235k max out — 3.4× cheaper than current |
| | `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324` | 1.00 | strong generalist |
| research | `qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507` | 0.35 | 7× cheaper than current for summarisation |
| | `mistralai/mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct` | 0.20 | leaner option |
| triage | keep current **+ pin provider** | 0.18 | the 28/36 → 33/36 gap was the provider, not the model |
| | `qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507` | 0.35 | far larger non-reasoning model for 2× the price |
| premium | `z-ai/glm-5.3` | 4.40 | **reassign here** — §4.4 |

### 4.4 The glm reassignment: right model, wrong tier

Measured (`HANDOVER.md` §6.4): `z-ai/glm-5.3` returns schema-shaped stubs when
asked to **plan**, across Together, Modal and the AkashML/Wafer rotation — so it
is the model, not the serving. The *same* model, as the independent reviewer,
caught a flaw nothing upstream had found (that a table rename and drop in one
migration script make the observation window between them impossible).

**Action:** move it from `MODEL_ARCHITECTURE` to `MODEL_PREMIUM`, and put a
non-reasoning model on architecture. Judge a tier by its job, not the model's
reputation.

### 4.5 Ruled out, so nobody re-investigates

- **`inference-net/schematron-v2-turbo` / `-small`** ($0.15 / $0.23). Tempting on
  price and name, but they are **HTML-to-JSON extraction** models that require
  extraction instructions through a specific mechanism. Wrong shape for a chat
  tier. Do not put them on triage.
- **`qwen/qwen3-reranker-8b`** is correctly **absent from the chat catalogue** —
  it is served via `/rerank`. This is why model validation needed the
  non-chat confirmation path, and it is not a missing-model bug.
- **22 zero-priced models** exist in the catalogue (free/promo). Not evaluated;
  treat with suspicion for anything whose classification decides review depth.

### 4.6 Provider allowlists fail over within themselves — verified live

Pinned the triage tier to `[Perplexity, StreamLake]`, where Perplexity does not
serve that model. **Result: succeeded via StreamLake.**

So `OPENROUTER_PROVIDER_ORDER` with several providers gives a measured quality
floor *and* availability, even with `allow_fallbacks: false`. That makes pinning
safe in deployment, not just in measurement:

| purpose | shape | why |
|---|---|---|
| measuring (evals) | **one** provider per tier | maximum reproducibility |
| deployment | a measured **allowlist**, 2–3 per tier | quality floor + failover |

```bash
OPENROUTER_PROVIDER_ORDER=triage:StreamLake,triage:DigitalOcean,architecture:Together,search:
```

A tier named with an empty value (`search:`) opts out of a general default.

### 4.7 Catalogue metadata worth keeping

- `perplexity/sonar-pro` **does not** advertise `structured_outputs` — fine,
  because `research.py` uses plain `chat`, not `chat_json`. Do not "fix" this.
- `google/gemini-2.5-flash` max completion tokens is **65,535**, well below
  other tiers — relevant if it is ever put on a long-output phase.
- A catalogue snapshot was saved to a scratchpad during this work and **is not
  persisted**. Re-fetch with `GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` (no auth
  required).

### 4.8 Ranked beta test plan

| # | test | command target | cost | upside |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `sonar` vs `sonar-pro` | `evals/grounding` | ~$0.05 + $0.35 | up to **90% off the dominant cost line** |
| 2 | architecture swap | `evals/scenarios/backend_index.yaml` | ~$0.15 each | removes the planning stub; ~65% off that tier |
| 3 | research swap | `evals/grounding` | ~$0.05 | 7× off a tier called 2–3× per workflow |
| 4 | triage candidate, pinned | `evals/scenarios/wide` | ~$0.03 | the remaining calibration gap |

---

## 5. ⚠️ Not included — must be pasted by the advisor session

The brief asked this file to contain four things that **were not in the
executing session's context**, and they have deliberately **not** been
reconstructed, because inventing them would put fabricated architectural
documents into a public repo under someone else's authorship:

| item | status |
|---|---|
| **Blueprint 001** — full text | ✅ **received — §7.** Its CI section already incorporates the rework from §3.2, so §3.2 is now background rather than a live instruction. |
| **Blueprint 002** — full text | ❌ still absent. |
| The owner's **verification response** from the prior turn | ❌ still absent. The executing session's prior turn was a model-selection question. |
| **"This turn's audit"** | ❌ absent as a supplied artifact. §1 and §2 are this session's own verification, done from the repo. |
| The **B6 plan** ("builds a minimal workflow instead") | ❌ still absent. Noted as the intended approach; the plan text is unknown. |

Everything in §1–§4 is independently verified against the repo or measured live,
and is safe to rely on. Paste the four remaining items and they can be appended
verbatim alongside §7.

---

## 6. Session handling

**Archive, do not resume.** The prior transcript is a read-only reference for
"what did we already try" — most usefully the four successive rewrites of the
triage risk guide, each of which failed for a reason now recorded in
`HANDOVER.md` §6.6 and recoverable in full from `git log -p autornd/engine/phases.py`.

Session history lives outside the repository, so nothing in this pass changes
it; the recommendation is unaffected either way.

---

## 7. Blueprint 001 — B1 (verbatim, as received)

**Status: executed 2026-09-14 — see §7.2 for what it actually took.**
Recorded here so the fresh session executes from the
repo rather than from pasted chat. Its CI section already folds in the rework
described in §3.2 (extend rather than create), which supersedes that section as
an instruction.

Note for the executor: the two prerequisites are stated inside the blueprint and
are not optional — diff the manifests for strays and confirm nothing else
references `requirements.txt`; and verify whether importing `autornd.main`
requires environment variables before writing the import smoke. Neither has been
done in this pass.

```text
B1 Goal: fix the install-breaker, the manifest class, and add the drift-catcher. One commit.

Instance: add "pyjwt>=2.8.0" to pyproject.toml dependencies.
Class — pick one (my recommendation: A):
A (single source): pyproject.toml becomes canonical. Dockerfile switches from pip install -r requirements.txt to COPY . . + RUN pip install --no-cache-dir .; delete requirements.txt; update README Quick Start; dev installs use .[dev].
B (conservative): keep both files; add a free test that parses both manifests and asserts their runtime-dependency sets agree, so drift fails CI.
Either way, Claude first diffs the two manifests for strays and confirms nothing else references requirements.txt.
CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml — push/PR, Python 3.12, pip install -e ".[dev]", import smoke (Claude must verify first whether importing autornd.main requires env vars — if Settings validates at import time, set the six MODEL_* tiers plus OPENROUTER_API_KEY to dummies in CI env), then pytest -q. Public repo → free Actions minutes, ~9 s.
Hygiene re-verify (the checks my sandbox couldn't run): git ls-files profiles/ → example.yaml only; git ls-files | grep .env → .env.example only; vendor-name grep across the tree → clean.
Test-first (convention 7): manifest-parity test (if B) or the CI import smoke (if A) written before touching the manifests.
Commit message: prose per convention 12 — a fresh editable install failed on import jwt, the root cause is two dependency manifests drifting in both directions, and CI now catches this class.
```

### 7.1 Standing observations relevant to executing it

Recorded now so they are not re-derived, but note these are **observations, not
the prerequisite work** — the diff and the import check still have to be run:

- The existing `test` job installs from `requirements.txt` across a
  3.11/3.12/3.13 matrix. **Under option A that job must also change**, or CI
  breaks the moment `requirements.txt` is deleted. Option A therefore touches
  both jobs, not just the new one.
- Under option A the drift-catcher is partly structural: with one manifest there
  is nothing to drift *between*, and installing from it in CI means a missing
  runtime dependency fails the suite directly (`tests/test_auth.py` imports the
  module that needs `jwt`). The import smoke still earns its place for anything
  the tests do not import — the startup path in `autornd/main.py` in particular.
- `requirements.txt` currently mixes runtime and dev dependencies (`pytest`,
  `pytest-asyncio`), which means the Docker image installs a test framework into
  production. Option A resolves that as a side effect; option B should decide
  whether the parity test compares runtime sets only.

---

### 7.2 Execution record — 2026-09-14, option A

The owner chose **option A** (single manifest). The blueprint's two stated
prerequisites were run first, and both changed the work.

**Prerequisite 1 — diff the manifests for strays.** Clean: `requirements.txt`
was `pyproject.toml`'s runtime block verbatim, same order and same pins, plus
`pyjwt>=2.8.0` and the two dev packages `pyproject` already carried under
`[dev]`. Live consumers of the file were four — `ci.yml:27`, `Dockerfile:5-6`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md:10`, `README.md:499`. All four now point at `pyproject.toml`.

**Prerequisite 2 — does importing `autornd.main` need env vars?** Yes, six.
`config.py:192` calls `_build_settings()` at module scope, which raises
`SystemExit` when any required tier is empty. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is *not*
required at import — it defaults to `""` — so the blueprint's instinct to set it
was right about the shape and wrong about the key. `tests/conftest.py` already
solves this with `os.environ.setdefault`, which is why the matrix job needs no
env block. The new job's env block is scoped to that job alone and deliberately
not made workflow-wide: putting it at the top level would mask a future
regression in conftest's injection.

**What the install actually found.** B1 was recorded as one line. Running
`pip install -e .` in a clean venv found **three faults, and the documented one
could not even be reached**:

| | fault | how it presented |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | flat-layout package discovery | `error: Multiple top-level packages discovered in a flat-layout: ['evals', 'autornd', 'profiles', 'workflows']` — the build aborts, so `pip install -e .` never got as far as importing anything |
| 2 | `pyjwt` absent from `pyproject.toml` | the documented B1; only observable once fault 1 was fixed |
| 3 | no package data in the wheel | `autornd/api/templates/dashboard.html` was in **no** built wheel, so every non-editable install served `FileNotFoundError` from the dashboard route |

Fault 3 is the interesting one: it was never going to surface from an editable
install either, and `CONTRIBUTING.md:52` had been telling people to
`pip install -e .` — which had been failing at build the whole time.

**Three departures from the §3.2 draft**, each forced by the above:

1. the `env:` block, per prerequisite 2;
2. a third step asserting a built wheel carries `dashboard.html`, because an
   import smoke passes happily on an install whose data files are missing;
3. the **matrix** job changed too (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`). The draft touched
   only the new job; deleting `requirements.txt` forces both, exactly as §7.1
   predicted.

**One departure from the blueprint's option A text.** It specified
`RUN pip install --no-cache-dir .` for the Dockerfile; the file uses `-e .`.
`workflow_path()` (`engine/workflow.py:38`) and `PROFILES_DIR` (`profiles.py:16`)
both resolve their data directory as `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent`, and
neither `workflows/` nor `profiles/` ships inside the package — verified by
inspecting the built wheel, whose only top-level entry is `autornd/`. A
relocating install therefore puts both at paths that do not exist. It would have
happened to work in the image, because `WORKDIR /app` shadows site-packages on
`sys.path` — which is luck, not design. Editable keeps one copy at `/app` and
both resolve by construction. The cost is the lost layer-caching of the old
`COPY requirements.txt` first step; there is no production deployment and the
image is not built in CI, so nothing is measurably worse.

**Verification.** Every claim above was produced by running it, in a throwaway
venv built from `get-pip.py` (this box has no `ensurepip`), against a copy of
the tree — never the repo, so no build artifacts reached the working directory:

- before: `pip install -e .` → build error, as quoted;
- after: install succeeds, `pyjwt-2.14.0` resolved, import smoke clean;
- both CI jobs replayed against the final tree — `-e ".[dev]"` + `pytest` →
  **501 passed**; `-e .` + import smoke → clean; `python -m build --wheel` →
  wheel carries the template.

**Left undone, deliberately.** Nothing exercises the **Docker build** — it is
now the only install shape no job covers, and it is recorded in `HANDOVER.md` §5
item 10 rather than fixed here. `CONTRIBUTING.md` got its install line only;
C1–C7 and C9–C10 remain Blueprint 002's.

**The generalisable lesson**, in the register of §6.8: 501 tests could not see
any of these three, because a test suite runs against the source tree and a
packaging fault lives in the metadata. One live install found all three in under
a minute. It is §6.8's lesson again in a new place — *the fault a suite is
structurally incapable of seeing is the one that ships.*

## 8. Inventory: CHANGELOG.md and CONTRIBUTING.md stale claims

Inventory only — **no fixes in this pass**; they land in Blueprint 002. Ordered
within each file by how much damage the claim does if believed.

### 8.1 CONTRIBUTING.md

| # | claim | why it is wrong |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | *"No comments unless the 'why' is non-obvious"* (Code Style) | Directly contradicts this project's strongest convention. Measurement comments are the codebase's most valuable property — nearly every constant carries the live run that set it. A contributor following this line would **strip** exactly that. |
| C2 | *"Workflow phases — add new phases in `autornd/engine/phases.py` and wire them into the sequencer"* | "The sequencer" is `engine/workflow.py`, the **legacy** path kept only as the graph's equivalence reference. Correct path: add `_phase_<name>` to `graph/adapter.py` and a node to a `workflows/*.yaml`. |
| C3 | *"wire new phases into `autornd/engine/workflow.py`"* (Building on AutoRnD) | Same error, stated more explicitly, in the section aimed at people extending without forking. |
| C4 | *"register its `SpecialistRole` in `autornd/models/verdicts.py`"* — appears **three times** (What to Work On, Building on AutoRnD, `[seam]` Specialist registry) | Roles are an **open vocabulary**. You declare them under `roles:` in a profile; an undeclared role resolves to a synthesized generalist. No enum edit is needed, and editing the enum is not how a project adds its own roles. |
| C5 | The `[seam]`/`[internal]` architecture list omits **`graph/`** entirely | `spec.py`, `executor.py`, `adapter.py`, `conditions.py`, `checks.py` — the actual engine — appear nowhere. A contributor reading the seam list would not learn the graph exists. `evals/` is likewise absent. |
| C6 | *"`[seam]` Review composition — risk-to-team mapping. Add new composition strategies here."* | The risk-to-team **table** was replaced by derivation from the specialists triage assigned; the signature is now `get_review_team(risk, domains, specialists)`. "Risk-to-team mapping" no longer describes it. |
| C7 | *"the sequencer, review composition, and routing layers all read from the registry dynamically"* | Outdated framing for the same reason as C6. |
| C8 | ~~`pip install -r requirements.txt` (Getting Started)~~ | **Fixed in Blueprint 001** — now `pip install -e ".[dev]"`. The rest of this file is untouched and remains Blueprint 002's. |
| C9 | `pytest tests/ -v` (Running Tests) | Repo convention is `-q`, and in the owner's environment `.venv/bin/python3 -m pytest` (pytest is not on PATH). |
| C10 | No mention of the eval suites, `--max-spend`, or the test-first convention | A contributor has no route to the cheapest quality signal in the project. |

### 8.2 CHANGELOG.md

Frozen at a single entry, `[0.1.0] — 2026-09-12`. Every claim below is in that
entry.

| # | claim | why it is wrong |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | *"Full test suite (85 tests)"* | Actual: **501**. |
| G2 | *"5-phase sequencer (triage, plan, implement, validate, review)"* | Now a 16-node YAML graph with gates, loops, escalation recovery, a review gate and a conditional independent pass. |
| G3 | *"K3 escalation autopsy pattern"* | Model nickname in a user-facing document; breaks the zero-model-names rule. |
| G4 | *"Risk-based review team composition (critical → all specialists, low → single specialist)"* | `critical` no longer returns all specialists — that behaviour was the measured defect that put seven engineers on a records-retention review. |
| G5 | *"OpenRouter multi-model routing client with cost tracking"* | Present but misleading: cost tracking missed research, context and rerank calls until `b4cd89f`, understating by 2.6×–295×. |
| G6 | *"7 engineering specialists"* | True as defaults, but the roster is open now — profiles declare their own. |
| G7 | **Unrecorded since 0.1.0** | The workflow graph as data; the eval harness (scenarios, assertions, bounded runner, per-tier spend); outward research with recall-before-search; open domain **and** role vocabularies; client-side accounting and budgets; provider recording and per-tier pinning; the review gate; the `unrecallable` axis; risk-scaled search budgets. |

**Note for Blueprint 002:** C1 and C4 are the two worth fixing first — C1 because
it invites the removal of the project's most valuable property, C4 because it is
repeated three times and sends every would-be extender to the wrong mechanism.
